<h1><b><i> Indian Butter Chicken </i></b></h1>

<h3> Descriton: </h3>

<p style = "font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: large;">
    Indian butter chicken, also known as Murgh Makhani, is a popular dish consisting of chicken marinated in a mixture of yogurt and spices, 
    typically including garam masala, cumin, turmeric, and chili. The marinated chicken is usually cooked in a tandoor (traditional clay oven) 
    but can also be grilled or pan-fried. It is then simmered in a rich, creamy tomato-based sauce made with butter, cream, and spices such as 
    fenugreek leaves (kasuri methi). The dish is known for its velvety texture and mild, slightly sweet flavor, often served with naan bread or 
    rice.
