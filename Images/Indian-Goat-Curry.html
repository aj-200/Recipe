<h3> Descriton: </h3>

<p style = "font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: large;">
    Indian goat curry, also known as "Mutton Curry" in India, is a flavorful and aromatic dish made with tender goat meat cooked in a rich, 
    spicy gravy. The dish typically includes a blend of spices such as cumin, coriander, turmeric, garam masala, and chili powder, along with 
    ingredients like onions, tomatoes, garlic, and ginger. The goat meat is often marinated in yogurt and spices to tenderize it and enhance its 
    flavor before being slow-cooked until it is succulent and infused with the aromatic spices. The result is a hearty and comforting curry, often 
    enjoyed with rice, naan, or roti.
