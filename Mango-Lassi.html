<h3> Descriton: </h3>

<p style = "font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: large;">
    Mango lassi is a popular traditional Indian drink made from ripe mangoes, yogurt, milk, and a touch of sweetener such as sugar or honey. 
    The ingredients are blended together until smooth, creating a thick, creamy, and refreshing beverage. Often, a pinch of cardamom is added 
    for extra flavor. Mango lassi is enjoyed chilled and is perfect for cooling down, especially during hot weather. It's both a delicious treat 
    and a nutritious drink, rich in vitamins and probiotics.
