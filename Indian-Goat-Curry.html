    Indian goat curry, also known as "Mutton Curry" in India, is a flavorful and aromatic dish made with tender goat meat cooked in a rich, spicy gravy. The dish typically includes a blend of spices such as cumin, coriander, turmeric, garam masala, and chili powder, along with ingredients like onions, tomatoes, garlic, and ginger. The goat meat is often marinated in yogurt and spices to tenderize it and enhance its flavor before being slow-cooked until it is succulent and infused with the aromatic spices. The result is a hearty and comforting curry, often enjoyed with rice, naan, or roti.
